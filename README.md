### 👋 Hi! I'm Douglas.


🤓 Before I decided to become a nerd, my background was in startup marketing.


🌊 I got my toes wet in technology doing things like:


- 🗂️ CRM administration
- 📈 working with business intelligence stuff
- 🛒 redesigning websites to actually get sales.


In all my work, I found that there was a common thread: I loved what technology was able to do for me, but I wanted it to do more. I could always make the most out of any tool I was using -- whether it be Salesforce.com, website builders like Shopify and Webflow, or various other communications, BI, or advertising technologies... but I always found myself thinking, "I sure wish this tool could..."

In 2022, I decided to move to Oklahoma and study computer programming, so I could make the tools myself.

I chose Atlas School -- though when I started, it was called Holberton School Tulsa -- because of its rigorous, hands-on, project-based curriculum that covered a wide range of technical concepts, skills, and tools in a collaborative environment. It wasn't just a little bootcamp: it was a full-fledged technological trade school, with a 20-month program that would take me from the very basics of Computer Science all the way through front- and back-end web tech.

From C to CSS, I learned to think programatically and apply a huge variety of modern web development technologies to real-world problems. And I found that I really loved programming! 

I've had the good fortune to work with a lot of languages and frameworks:

- C
- Python
- Bash scripting
- Databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Firestore) and ORMs
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the frontend
- JavaScript on the backend! NodeJS, Express
- GraphQL and REST APIs

And, I've also been able to experience the joy of teaching these concepts to others! I currently work as a Student Tutor for Atlas School. It's so much fun to help people understand the concepts that I learned just a few trimesters ahead of them. 'Peer Learning' is the backbone of Atlas School, and working as a Student Tutor has helped me double down on this more than anything else. I find I understand things so much more after explaining them in 8 different ways! 

If you're interested in seeing some of the ways I've approached sharing these topics -- or just want to see pictures of me dressed up as JavaScript (personified) or Orm, the SQLAlchemist (great wizard hat!), I encourage you to check out my repo where I keep some of my presentation materials!
